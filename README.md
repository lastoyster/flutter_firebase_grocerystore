#flutter firebase grocery app

Grocery App in Flutter with Payment Gateway (GPay, Apple Pay, UPI, Credit/Debit Card)


## Stripe Payment Gateway Setup

We used [flutter_stripe](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_stripe) for payment in our Grocery Flutter (Android & iOS) app. Please read this plugin documentation carefully to setup Stripe Payment's server. 


## Getting Started
  - If you don't have Flutter SDK installed, please visit official [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) site.
  - Fetch latest source code from master branch.
 
 ```
 git clone https://github.com/lastoyster/flutter_firebase_grocerystore.git
 ```  
 - Run the app with Android Studio or Visual Studio. Or the command line.

 ```
 flutter run
 ```
